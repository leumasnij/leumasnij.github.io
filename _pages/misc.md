Here is some fun facts about me:

I was born and raised in the beautiful of Shenzhen in southern China next to Hong Kong. Everytime I need to travel internationally I would fly from HKG, and I have experienced (many times) one of the longest flight routes in the world: HKG-JFK. Spoiler alert: NOT FUN.

My Chinese name is 金聖苗（金圣苗）. When I was born my grandma find a Chinese Psychic(算命) to give my parents a list of Chinese characters that will give me a better future, the character need to have specific number of lines, so that is why I used the traditional character here. My English preferred name 'Samuel' sounds very similar to 'Shengmiao' and my mom picks it out of the Bible. For most international students the English name is a way for people not mispronocing their actual name, but for me my parents had been called me 'Samuel' since I was young and they hardly used my actual name. That is why I got used to be called 'Samuel' more than 'Shengmiao'. The name "$\textbf{Leumas}$" is insipred by Horace Miner's work [Body Ritual Among the Nacirema](https://www.sfu.ca/~palys/Miner-1956-BodyRitualAmongTheNacirema.pdf).

Despite I graduated as Valendictorian from high school, (oldest boarding school in the US!), I am not able to attend graduation in person due to Covid-19. I also never officially graduated from middle school, because I came to US for 9th grade, and in Chinese education system 9th grade is till middle school. So fingers crossed for college graduation :)
