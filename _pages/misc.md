Here is some fun facts about me:

My Chinese name is 金聖苗（金圣苗）. When I was born my grandma find a Chinese Psychic(算命) to give my parents a list of Chinese characters that will give me a better future, the character need to have specific number of lines, so that is why I used the traditional character here. My English preferred name 'Samuel' sounds very similar to 'Shengmiao' and my mom picks it out of the Bible. For most international students the English name is a way for people not mispronocing their actual name, but for me my parents had been called me 'Samuel' since I was young and they hardly used my actual name. That is why I got used to be called 'Samuel' more than 'Shengmiao'. The name "$\textbf{Leumas}$" is insipred by Horace Miner's work [Body Ritual Among the Nacirema](https://www.sfu.ca/~palys/Miner-1956-BodyRitualAmongTheNacirema.pdf). It also sounds like some Ancient Greek Philosopher so I let all my friends call me this in College.

My high school Alma Mater, $\textbf{West Nottingham Academy}$, is claimed to be the oldest Boarding School in the US, and is founded in 1744.
