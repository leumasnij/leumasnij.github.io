## Application Documents

I still remember how lost and confused I was during the summer before my PhD application season. In order to give many people guidance and help them through the application process, I decided to make all of my writings public as a reference to whoever is in need. Please feel free to use these documents to get started, but remember that each application should be personalized to reflect your own experiences and goals.
