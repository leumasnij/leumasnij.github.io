## About Me

My name is **Shengmiao ('Samuel') Jin**, and I am an Incoming <span style="color: #3498db">Robotics Ph.D. Student (in the Field of Computer Science) </span> at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cornell University</span>. Currently, I am an Undergraduate student at the <span style="color:rgb(237, 74, 46)">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</span> majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am currently working in the <span style="color: #3498db">[RoboTouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/)</span> with <span style="color: #2ecc71">[Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz)</span> on <span style="color: #e74c3c">Dexterous Manipulation with Tactile Sensing</span>.
