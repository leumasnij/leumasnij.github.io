# Welcome to My Page! 👋

Exploring the intersection of Robotics, AI, and Human-Robot Interaction

## About Me

My name is **Shengmiao ('Samuel') Jin**, and I am an Incoming <span style="color: #3498db">Robotics Ph.D. Student (in the Field of Computer Science) </span> at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cornell University</span>. Currently, I am an Undergraduate student at the <span style="color:rgb(237, 74, 46)">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</span> majoring in Electrical Engineering.

## Research Interests

I am passionate about:

* 🤖 <span style="color: #3498db">Dexterous Manipulation</span>
* 🖐️ <span style="color: #2ecc71">Tactile Sensing</span>
* 🧠 <span style="color: #e74c3c">Robot Learning</span>
* ⚙️ <span style="color: #9b59b6">Model-based Control</span>

*My goal is to develop systems to help humans with complex daily tasks that require the feeling of touch.*

## Current Research

I am currently working in the <span style="color: #3498db">[RoboTouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/)</span> with <span style="color: #2ecc71">[Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz)</span> on <span style="color: #e74c3c">Dexterous Manipulation with Tactile Sensing</span>. My research includes:

* <span style="color: #3498db">Food (pancake batter) manipulation</span>
* <span style="color: #e74c3c">Active Haptic Perception</span>
* <span style="color: #9b59b6">Tactile Representation Learning</span>

Check out my [publications](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) for more details!


## Personal Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy:

* 📚 Reading
* 🍳 Cooking
* ✈️ Traveling
* 🎮 Playing and watching sports (including esports)
