My name is Shengmiao ('Samuel') Jin, also likes to be called 'Leumas'. 
I am currently an Undergraduate student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign(UIUC) majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am generally interested in Robotics, Tactile Sensing, Computer Vision, and their intersection in Tactile-informed Robot Manipulation tasks. My goal is to develop system to help human with common daily tasks that require the feeling of touch.

I am currently working in the [RoboTouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/) with [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz) on improving grasp stability with tactile sensing. I have also worked on liquid manipulation, specifically, a pancake-making system that can make arbitrary shape of pancakes.(We have very cool demos!)

Previously, I worked on Biomedical Image Processing while interning at [a genetic company in Shenzhen](https://en.genomics.cn/) in 2023. I also briefly worked on Neural Networks-based Unfolding Algorithm for Particle Physics at Tufts University during Summer 2020.

Outside of research, I also like to read, cook, travel, play and watch sports(including esports).
