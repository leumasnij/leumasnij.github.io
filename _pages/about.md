## About Me

My name is **Shengmiao ('Samuel') Jin**, and I am an first-year <span style="color: #3498db">Robotics Ph.D. Student (in the Field of Computer Science) </span> at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cornell University</span>. I am currently co-advised by [Professor Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://sites.google.com/site/tapomayukh) and [Professor Preston Culbertson](https://pculbertson.github.io/). My research interest lies in the intersection of Dexterous Manipulation, Tactile Sensing and Robot Learning.
I graduated from the <span style="color:rgb(237, 74, 46)">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</span> with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in May 2025. 
During my time at UIUC, I was fortunate to work in the [RoboTouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/) with [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz) .


## Past Research

During my wonderful time at UIUC as an undergrad, I worked on these following projects:

* <span style="color: #3498db">Food (pancake batter) manipulation</span>
* <span style="color: #e74c3c">Active Haptic Perception</span>
* <span style="color: #9b59b6">Tactile Representation Learning</span>

Check out my [publications](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) for more details!

## Personal Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy:

* üìö Reading
* üç≥ Cooking
* ‚úàÔ∏è Traveling
