# Welcome to My Page!

Exploring the intersection of Robotics, AI, and Human-Robot Interaction

## 👋 About Me

My name is **Shengmiao ('Samuel') Jin**, and I am an Incoming Robotics Ph.D. Student (in the Field of Computer Science) at Cornell University. Currently, I am an Undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) majoring in Electrical Engineering.

## 🎯 Research Interests

I am passionate about:

* 🤖 Robotics
* 🖐️ Tactile Sensing
* 👁️ Computer Vision
* 🔄 Tactile-informed Robot Manipulation

*My goal is to develop systems to help humans with common daily tasks that require the feeling of touch.*

## 🔬 Current Research

I am currently working in the [RoboTouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/) with [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz) on Dexterous Manipulation with Tactile Sensing. My research includes:

* 🥞 Liquid manipulation and pancake-making system
* 🤖 Various robotics projects

Check out my [publications](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) for more details!



Outside of research, I enjoy:

* 📚 Reading
* 🍳 Cooking
* ✈️ Traveling
* 🎮 Playing and watching sports (including esports)
