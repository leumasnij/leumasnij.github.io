I am Shengmiao ('Samuel') Jin, also likes to be called 'Leumas' which was insipred by Horace Miner's work [Body Ritual Among the Nacirema](https://www.sfu.ca/~palys/Miner-1956-BodyRitualAmongTheNacirema.pdf). I am currently an Undergraduate student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign(UIUC) majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am generally interested in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning and their application in common daily tasks.
